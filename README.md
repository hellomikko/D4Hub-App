## Welcome to the D4 Hub Application

- I do not have any rights too these sites or some logo and character images.
- However, character background images are designed by me.
- This app was created more-so for educational purposes and more of a convivence for me, while in game,
not having to go outside of the actual game window onto a browser. Especially launching multiple
sites in-which I normally do regardless of the 4 screens I use. So I created this to keep up with other
skills also.
- If you enjoy or find use of this app, please hit the ‚≠ê button top right! Id appriciate it.
- If you are too a developer like myself, would like to contribute to this, please hit the **Fork** button.
